#### Semantic segmentation: Problem Formulation:
- Pixel classification with semantic labels: Semantic segmentation
- Partitioning of individual objects: Instance segmentation
#### [[(2015) FCN - Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation|FCNs]] for semantic segmentation
- FCNs are able to take an *arbitrarily-sized* input image and produce a *correspondingly-sized* output, as opposed to other CNN architectures (vgg, resnet,...) by reinterpreting the fully connected layers as fully convolutional layers
- FCNs have proven to be especially useful for dense prediction tasks *(e.g. semantic segmentation & object detection)*
- Limitations of FCNs include ignoring of global scene-level context and poor generalisation to 3D images.
#### Convolutional models x [[Fundamentals#Markov Random Field models|Graphical models]]
The main purpose of exploring graphical models is to include more contextual information into the model and improve semantic image segmentation. 
CRFs can be trained separately from neural network or trained jointly.
#### Encoder-Decoder based models
The paper brings up several Encoder-Decoder-based models:
- **DeconvNet** (Noh et al, 2015)
- **SegNet** (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017): its main contribution is to save the max pooling indices to be used in the unpooling operation in the decoder network. Eliminating the need for learning upsampling filters, as in FCN
>> [!warning] This technique seems to have been used in the (Noh et al, 2015) paper too, is it really a novelty?
- **HRNet** (Sun et al., 2019): instead of going down the approach of U-net-like networks of recovering the resolution of the feature maps in the decoder network through upsampling and 'deconvolution' techniques, the authors explore the approach of maintaining high-resolution representation using high-resolution convolution, and strengthening them with parallel low-resolution convolutions. This technique is relevant to semantic segmentation and object detection. The authors present a couple version of the network HRNetV1 (a), HRNetV2 (b), HRNetV2p (c)

	- **Unet++**: Unet nested variant (Zhou et al, 2018)
- **ResUNet** (Zhang et al, 2018): Combined U-Net & ResNet for a road extraction task on remote sensing images from the Massachusetts Roads dataset
- **V-Net** (Milletari et al., 2016): used for 3D image segmentation. The authors introduced a new ==Dice coefficient-based== objective function
#### Multi-scale and Pyramid Network based models
- [[(FPN) Feature Pyramid Network]] (Lin et al., 2017): bottom-up + top-down + lateral connections. FPNs make use of the inherent hierarchical nature of CNNs to produce predictions at all scales of features.

- **(PSPN) Pyramid Scene Parsing Network** (Zhao et al, 2017): 
	- Resnet as feature extractor
	- Pyramid pooling module: performs pooling at different scales
	- Pooling results are up-sampled to the initial feature map resolution and concatenated to capture global and local context
	- Conv layers to generate pixel-wise predictions

> [!bug]- Limitations
> - [[#Encoder-Decoder based models|(Enc-Dec)]] The main limitation of encoder-decoder based models is the loss of the fine-grained information due to the loss of the high-resolution representations during encoding. This limitation is however mitigated by HRNets.
