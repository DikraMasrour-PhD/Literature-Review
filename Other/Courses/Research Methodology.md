How to review a research paper?
*Homework* Review [Band Attention Convolutional Networks For Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04379) maybe ==newer paper==
- to be presented, maybe try and grade the paper + sentence (accept, reject, border accept) + comments
- look for a review report template
